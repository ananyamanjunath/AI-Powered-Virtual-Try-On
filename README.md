## Introduction
This project aims to enhance the online shopping experience through an innovative AI Try-On feature, enabling users to visualize products using Augmented Reality (AR) before making a purchase. This feature aims to bridge the gap between digital and physical shopping experiences, providing users with a more interactive and engaging way to shop online.

## Wireframes
The wireframes outline the user journey across four main web pages:

## How to Use These Wireframes
Developers can use these wireframes as a blueprint to build the front end of the AI Try-On feature. Each page is designed to ensure a seamless user journey from landing on the homepage to checking out. Specific guidelines include:
- Ensure the AI Try-On link is prominently displayed on the homepage for easy access.
- The 'Start Trial' button on the AI Try-On Details Page should directly lead users to the interactive Try-On feature.
- Implement AR technology on the AI Try-On Page for a realistic product visualization experience.
- The Checkout Page should summarize the items, and prices, and provide a straightforward checkout process.

Please use these wireframes to guide the development process and maintain consistency with the user experience design I've included here.
